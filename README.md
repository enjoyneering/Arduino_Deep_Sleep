# Arduino_Deep_Sleep

An Arduino example of the proper and most advanced way to put any AVR MCU into sleep

This example puts AVR MCU in deep sleep for 30 seconds. Wakes it up, turns on/off LED and returns Arduino back to sleep. Average ATtiny85 consumption in deep sleep mode, achieved by this sketch, is ~3 microamperes at 3.3 volt.
